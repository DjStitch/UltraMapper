TODO:

- DateTime and Dynamic mapping,
- Object to Object mapping should inspect object types and use ReferenceMapper.
  At this time it copies the reference value (no mapping at all). Remove obejct from built in types.
- Abstract and base classes map with derived types inheriting the configuration
- VERIFY_MAPPING: Search for objects sharing the same reference in the source and check 
  that on the target those objects are mapped to a single object sharing the same reference
