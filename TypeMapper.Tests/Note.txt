TODO:

- DateTime and Dynamic mapping

- Object to Object mapping should inspect object types and use ReferenceMapper.
  At this time it copies the reference value (no mapping at all). Remove obejct from built in types.

- Abstract and base classes map with derived types inheriting the configuration

- VERIFY_MAPPING: Search for objects sharing the same reference in the source and check 
  that on the target those objects are mapped to a single object sharing the same reference

- private members mapping

KNOWN (POTENTIAL) PROBLEMS:

- ReferenceTracking and other dictionaries that should take as key a pair of object ( such as Dictionary<TypePair,*> ),
for performance reasons, calculate a hashcode of the pair itself and use this hashcode as the key.
When dealing with many many object and types, this can lead to collisions and therefore unexpected behaviors of the mapper.
Since it is unknown if this can happen in practice and due to the performance cost of using any different approach,
the problem is ignored until it shows up in real world usage.
