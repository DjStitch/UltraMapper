TODO:

- ArrayMapper does not handle CollectionBehaviors.

- Automatic reverse mapping (at the time a reverse mapping is a normal mapping
  encountered at execution time and resolved by convention. Take into account manual overrides.)

- Dynamic mapping

- Object to Object mapping should inspect object types and use ReferenceMapper.
  At this time it copies the reference value (no mapping at all).
  [This is somehow solved, as we faced a similar issue with interfaces]

- Configuration inheritance (ie. IgnoreConvention)
- Abstract and base classes map with derived types inheriting the configuration
- Simple members inherits type mapping configuration BUT complex types do not.
- Member configuration should work regardless the type of the members involved.
  This would solve EntityFramework problems with DynamicProxies not reading the 
  configuration (stored by type and not taken into account because concrete object type != dynamic proxied type).
  Type configuration, instead, obviously should work only exactly for the specified types

- VERIFY_MAPPING: Search for objects sharing the same reference in the source and check 
  that on the target those objects are mapped to a single object sharing the same reference

- When working with interfaces if the source has a member instantiated, we use the same type on the target (by convention)
  but i'm not checking if the source is null.

- Should map using the runtime-used type which could be a type inherited/derived from the declared type.  
  At the moment: 
	If a member is backed by an interface, only interface's member are mapped.
	If a member is backed by a super class, only superclass' members are mapped
  
- Configurators need extra overloads to cover target member mapping via methods Get/Set
  (both untyped (MemberInfo), and strongly types (Lambdas) helpers are missing).

- Multidimensional/jagged arrays; 

OPTIMIZATIONS:

- Performance are not an issue but a lot of reflection work is not being cached. Reflection already caches internally
  but here we do a lot of additional work that should be also cached and could even be shared among various configuration instances. 

KNOWN (POTENTIAL) PROBLEMS:

- Configurations can be shared, but not subsequently edited because conventions and expression builders are not run again.
  Introduce a seal mechanism to inform the user about this; or a configuration refresh mechanism. 

- When manually mapping using deep nested selectors (ie: projections, ie: x=>x.PropertyA.GetMethodB().GetFieldC() ), 
  all instances referred by the selector (both on source and target) must be instantiated. 
    
  At the time to avoid NullReferenceException on target side
  it is possible to instantiate the target and set 
  ReferenceMappingStrategy = USE_TARGET_INSTANCE_IF_NOT_NULL.
  
  SOURCE SIDE: The problem is solved by checking for null references before accessing members.
  
  TARGET SIDE: An automatic mechanism instantiating a new instance if a null reference is found could be useful 
  to solve the problem on target side. This mechamism should take into account types configurations
  and CustomConstructors, if possible at all.

- Collection mapping strategies: when updating order is not preserved 
  (this could be right since it is implied that we keep using the existing target collection).

- a. Reference type's CustomConverters do not recurse on inner references.
     (this might be correct since the entire mapping is delegated to the user).   
  b. CustomConverters do not add references to the ReferenceTracker.

- Mapping types not providing a parameterless constructor directly is probably feasible but would need a big refactor.
  One example is ReadOnlyCollection support: it is supported only if we find it as a target's member.
